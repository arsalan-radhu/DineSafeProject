## Introduction
#### While we were students at Brainstation, we were challenged by Toronto Open Data to make one of their data sets more accessible and to prove its value to stakeholders and the public in a 24-hour hackathon. We wanted to develop our solution further, present our findings, and suggest improvements for making this data set more accessible to all those who need it.
